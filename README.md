# VBA-challenge
Stock Behaivor

This code will help you to summarize the behavior of the value of each of the series of shares evaluated in the quarter, giving you both the amount and the percentage with respect to its opening value. It will also indicate the series with the greatest growth in its percentage of change, the one that had the lowest growth in its percentage of change and the series that had the highest volume of operations.

I hope it is useful to you.
